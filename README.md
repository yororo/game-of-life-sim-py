# Game of Life Simulation

Python script that simulates game of life by John Horton Conway in 1970. The rules are the following:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Uses matplotlib to display the simulation in animation.

# How to Run
Simply execute the script 'py main.py'
